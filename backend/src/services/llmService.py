llmService.py

This module handles LLM (Large Language Model) interactions for the gfvrho project.
It demonstrates how to integrate with LangChain, as well as external providers such as
ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Perplexity for generating textual content.

We expose a single public function:
- generate_report_content(tier, userData, marketData)

Best Practices:
1. Store API keys and credentials in a secure location (AWS Secrets Manager, SSM Parameter Store).
2. Keep provider-specific logic encapsulated here, so other services just call this module.
3. Handle exceptions gracefully, including rate limiting or timeout errors from external APIs.
4. For production, add more robust logging, retries, and error handling.

NOTE: The code below contains illustrative placeholders for actual LLM calls. Depending on 
the library versions and usage, you may need to adjust method names and parameters.

        f"Focus on analyzing potential investment opportunities, highlighting relevant metrics."
